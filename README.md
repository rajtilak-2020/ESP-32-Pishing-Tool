# WiFi Pishing Tool Based On ESP-32üî™

This project creates a WiFi login portal for the mentioned SSID Network , allowing victims to log in with their email and password to gain access to the fake network. The portal runs on an ESP32 board and utilizes the `WiFiMulti`, `DNSServer`, and `WebServer` libraries to handle network requests and DNS spoofing.
